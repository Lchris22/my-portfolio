PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE
Software Engineer (Platform & SRE Team) | Persistent Systems (Client: IBM) September 2023 – Present
• Observability Stack Ownership: Managed the lifecycle of the monitoring stack (Prometheus, Grafana, Loki, Thanos) on OpenShift clusters. Executed critical version upgrades to resolve vulnerabilities and replaced legacy components (e.g., ubi-oauth-proxy to origin-oauth-proxy) to ensure compliance.
• GitOps Implementation: Designed and maintained ArgoCD workflows using ApplicationSets for dynamic, scalable deployments across multiple cloud providers (AWS, Azure).
• Infrastructure Automation: Utilized Go templating in Helm charts to create conditional logic for single-source deployments, ensuring accurate configuration across distinct cloud environments.
• Incident Response & Debugging: Acted as primary Dev-Support for platform incidents. Resolved high-priority issues such as:
    ◦ Fixing Teleport database misconfigurations to restore bastion access.
    ◦ Troubleshooting Grafana OAuth lockouts and "taint" issues causing deployment crashes.
    ◦ Restoring sequential data gaps in Prometheus and fixing Thanos datasource credential errors.
• Pipeline Optimization: Replaced legacy shell scripts with modular Python automation in the CI/CD pipeline, improving error handling and significantly reducing debugging time for deployments.
• Security Engineering: Hardened cluster security by configuring OAuth authentication, managing secrets via Azure Key Vault, and implementing secure private routes for isolated cluster communication.
